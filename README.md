# Python-Test


I'm going to try to use this git repository to learn about taking a python program through differnt stages of development.

* Adding files
* Creating branches
  * adding functions
* Merging changes back into the master path.
* Milestone versions?
* Projects
  * Create cards
  * Project automation?
* Issues
  * Create and track issues
  
## Need to see
Have to figure out what this does, and why I would want to use it.

### Also need to figure out
Does this change anything?
