# Python-Test


I'm going to try to use this git repository to learn about taking a python program through different stages of development.

* Adding files
* Creating branches
  * adding functions
* Merging changes back into the master path.
* Milestone versions?
* Projects
  * Create cards
  * Project automation?
* Issues
  * Create and track issues

Trying to learn how to use this editor.  Not sure what to make of it yet.
This thing does so much.  Hard to get my head wrapped around it.
>This is some odd form of Text

Oh I see.  Now that I have created a blank line, it doesn't format like that. Need to figure out how to do the other code blocks.  

    Ok, so if I tab in twice. I get this
    interesting block of text.
    Not sure what they call this.
    I wonder what other markdown this thing can do

## What else?
### So this is level3
#### Level4
1) So this is an ordered list.
2) More of this list
3) and now More
  4) Indented?
5) And not indented.
