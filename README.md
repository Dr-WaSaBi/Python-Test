# Python-Test


I'm going to try to use this git repository to learn about taking a python program through different stages of development.

* Adding files
* Creating branches
  * adding functions
* Merging changes back into the master path.
* Milestone versions?
* Projects
  * Create cards
  * Project automation?
* Issues
  * Create and track issues

>This is some odd form of Text

Oh I see.  Now that I have created a blank line, it doesn't format like that. Need to figure out how to do the other code blocks.

    Ok, so if I tab in twice. I get this
    interesting block of text.
    Not sure what they call this.
    I wonder what other markdown this thing can do
